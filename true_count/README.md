Blackjack True Count Training Program: This game is called Blackjack True Count and consists of one exercise.

Running Count Exercise:

First, the program will present you with values for:

- decks played
- running count (RC)

Your job is to input the True Count (TC = RC / Decks Remaining) and the program will inform you if your response is correct or not. 

The program will record how many rounds are played, how many mistakes are made, and the time it takes for the user to answer.
Metrics are output to the user to summarize their performance.

Once this program is mastered to satisfaction, check out blackjack/deviation_true_count/deviations.py to combine this exercise with a deviation exercise.
