 - this was created to track how long it takes to count down a deck of cards using the "Hi-Lo" technique
 - the timer starts/stops by hitting the "enter" key
 - when time is called, the user must input how many mistakes they made, and the program will add a time penalty
 - each iteration of the timer is similar to a loop on a stopwatch
 - metrics are output to the user to summarize their performance
