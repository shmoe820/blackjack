Blackjack Deviation Training Program: This game is called Blackjack Deviations and consists of two exercises.

Running Count Exercise:

First, the program will present you with values for:
- number of card decks
- decks played
- running count (RC)

Your job is to input the True Count (TC = RC / Decks Remaining) and the program will inform you if your response is correct or not. 

Note: Running Count Exercise is not available to deviations_true_count_given.py

Deviations Exercise:

Next, the program will present you with a player hand and a dealer hand.  
Your job is to input the correct play based on Blackjack Basic Strategy and True Count Deviations: 
- [H]it
- [S]tand
- [DH] double otherwise (o/w) hit
- [DS] double o/w stand
- s[P]lit
- [RH] surrender o/w hit
- [RS] surrender o/w stand
- [I]nsurance. 

Possible correct responses are the letters shown in the brackets above.
For example: if the correct decision is [H]it, input 'H'. 

User inputs are not case sensitive.

A summary file will be created at the completion of the program to log the user's performance.
