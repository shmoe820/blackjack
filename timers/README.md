# blackjack/timers

single_deck.py
 - this program acts as a timer (for anything, really)
 - this was created to track how long it takes to count down a deck of cards using the "Hi-Lo" technique
 - the timer starts/stops by hitting the "enter" key
 - when time is called, the user must input how many mistakes they made, and the program will add a time penalty
 - each iteration of the timer is similar to a loop on a stopwatch
 - metrics are output to the user to summarize their performance

double_deck.py
 - this program is similar to single_deck.py but outputs to a different csv summary file
 - these two programs could be the same, but the user would need to choose the name of the summary file that the metrics should be saved under
 - this was created to track how long it takes to count down two deck of cards using the "Hi-Lo" technique

- this program is similar to single_deck but outpts to a different csv summary file
